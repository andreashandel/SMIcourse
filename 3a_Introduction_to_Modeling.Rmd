# Overview
This module provides a brief introduction to simulation modeling.

# Learning Objectives
* Know what simulation modeling is.

# Slides
We will go over an introduction to modeling in one of the zoom sessions. 
There are two sets of slides. 
The first one giving a general introduction to modeling. You can get the slides here [as html](./slides/Introduction_to_Modeling_Slides.html) or [as pdf.](./slides/Introduction_to_Modeling_Slides.pdf)

The second one which discusses a few simple models. You can get the slides here [as html](./slides/Simple_Models_Slides.html) or [as pdf.](./slides/Simple_Models_Slides.pdf)


# Reading

The other units in this module cover specific topics in some more detail.


# Further materials

Our recent review [Simulation Modelling for Immunologists](https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2020-handel-natrevimm/) provides a general introduction to the kinds of simulation models we will be discussing in this course. If you haven't done yet, please read the paper. 

See the _Resources_ section for some additional materials, including a few textbooks, that cover within-host modeling. Some of the other readings in this module also have further pointers to additional material.
