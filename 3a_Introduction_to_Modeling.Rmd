# Overview
This module provides a brief introduction to simulation modeling.

# Learning Objectives
* Know what simulation modeling is.

# Slides
We will go over an introduction to modeling in one of the zoom sessions. The slides for that session [can be found here.](./slides/Introduction_to_Modeling_Slides.html)


# Reading

The other units in this model cover specific topics in some more detail.


# Further materials

Our recent review [Simulation Modelling for Immunologists](https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2020-handel-natrevimm/) provides a general introduction to the kinds of simulation models we will be discussing in this course. If you haven't done yet, please read the paper. 

See the _Resources_ section for some additional materials, including a few textbooks, that cover within-host modeling. Some of the other readings in this module also have further pointers to additional material.
