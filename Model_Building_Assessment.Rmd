# Overview
This module provides some pointers towards becoming both a good consumer and producer of simulation models.

# Learning Objectives
* Know the different considerations to take into account when building and using model.
* Be able to critically assess the quality of models and model results reported in the literature.


# Slides
We probably won't have time to discuss this topic in one of the zoom sessions. Therefore, there are no slides.


# Reading

The other units in this module contain information on both the building and assessing components of papers that use simulation models.


# Further materials

See the individual units for pointers to further materials.
