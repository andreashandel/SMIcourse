# Overview
This document provides materials that discuss a few important viral pathogens and the immune response to those pathogens.

# Learning Objectives
* Describe the basic features of all virus life cycles
* Distinguish the “big picture” unique aspects of HCV, influenza virus, and coronavirus
* Define how in vitro experiments can be used to predict in vivo virus biology

# Slides
We will go over this topic in one of the zoom sessions. The slides for that session [can be found here.](./slides/Viral_Infections_and_Immunology_Slides.pdf)
