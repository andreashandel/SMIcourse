# Overview
This document describes the idea of structural uncertainty, the fact that every model is a simplified version of reality and the way such simplifications are implemented can impact results.

# Learning Objectives
* Be familiar with the idea of structural uncertainty.
* Know how to explore the impact of structural uncertainty.



## Structural Uncertainty
* Models are simplifications and abstractions of the real world.
* Specific assumptions lead to different models.
* Every model is 'wrong' in some sense, but some might be useful.
* We need to decide which variables and processes to include and which to exclude.

```{r mapfigure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Which one is the right model of Georgia?", out.width="100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./media/mapfigure.png")
```

# Structural Uncertainty
  * Include age or not?
  * Allow for co-infection or not?
  * Include treatment or not?
* Once we have decided on that, we need to decide how to model each process.
  * What type of model? (ODE, IBM, etc.)
  * How to implement each process?


Growth: Exponential or Linear or Saturating?

# Structural Uncertainty - Example 2
Dobrovolny et al compared different influenza models and assessed how they matched experimental data.

```{r dobrovolny, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Top: models, bottom: data', out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./media/dobrovolny.png")
```
