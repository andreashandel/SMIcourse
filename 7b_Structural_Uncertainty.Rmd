## Uncertainty in model results

* Model results have different sources of uncertainty attached to them.
* Not all types of uncertainty are always explicitly acknowledged. 
* That's true not only for mathematical/computer models.

## Structural Uncertainty
* Models are simplifications and abstractions of the real world.
* Specific assumptions lead to different models.
* Every model is 'wrong' in some sense, but some might be useful.
* We need to decide which variables and processes to include and which to exclude.

```{r mapfigure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="", out.width="80%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../media/nri_review_modeldetail.png")
```


## Structural Uncertainty
* Include certain variables/components not? 
* How to formulate mechanisms/processes?
* What type of model? (ODE, IBM, etc.)


## Example variants of specific processes
Exponential or Linear growth? 
Mass-action or saturating killing?

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{B} & = g B - d_B B - kBI\\
\dot{I} & = r BI - d_I I \\
\\
\dot{B} & = g  - d_B B - \frac{kBI}{I+s}\\
\dot{I} & = r BI - d_I I \\
\end{aligned}
$$



## Structural Uncertainty Example 
Dobrovolny et al. (2013 PLoS One) compared different influenza models and assessed how they matched experimental data.

```{r dobrovolny, echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Top: models, bottom: data', out.width = '90%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../media/dobrovolny.png")
```


## Structural Uncertainty - Summary
* The biggest source of variability in outcomes.
* No systematic way to deal with it.
* Often discussed/addressed the least. Comparison of results across models is rare.
* Topical example: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/forecasting-us.html

## Structural Uncertainty - Practice

* The _Model variant exploration_ app in DSAIRM explores the impact of different model formulations.




## An Analogy


## Different assumptions for important mechanisms
* Should we include B-cells or T-cells or both?
* Do we need to include innate response components, if yes which?
* How do the different components/variables interact?

## Different assumptions for important mechanisms
$$\dot U =n - d_U U - bVU - k_1FU $$
$$\dot I = bVU - d_II - k_2FI - k_4 A I $$
$$\dot V = \frac{pI}{1+k_3 F} - d_VV - bVU - k_6AV$$
$$\dot F = p_F - d_F F + f_1  V (F_{max} - F) $$
$$\dot A = a_1 F A + a_2\frac{V}{V+h_V}F  $$


## Different variants of specific terms
* Interaction: Mass-action or saturating
* Growth: Exponential or Linear or Saturating?

## Different variants of specific terms
$$\dot U =n - d_U U - bVU $$
$$\dot I = bVU - d_II  - k_4 A I - k_5 \frac{A I}{A+s_A}$$
$$\dot V = \frac{pI}{1+k_3 F} - d_VV - bVU - k_6AV$$
$$\dot F = p_F - d_F F + f_1  V (F_{max} - F) + f_2  \frac{V}{V+s_V} F$$
$$\dot A = a_1 F A + a_2\frac{V}{V+h_V}F + a_3  \frac{F  V}{ F  V + h_V}  A $$
