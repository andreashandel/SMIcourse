# Introduction

Together with the materials (videos and readings) on this website, we make use of software to teach the topic.

Specifically, we wrote an R package called Dynamical Systems Approach to Immune Response Modeling (DSAIRM), which we assume you'll be using to learn the material.

The other units in this module will provide quick explanations on how to install and set up all required software.
