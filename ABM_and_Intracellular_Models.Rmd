# Overview

This document provides links to materials that provide a brief discussion of agent/individual based models (ABM/IBM) and intracellular models. The models are also multi-scale. 
A quick mention of re-assortment and modeling shows up as well.


# Learning Objectives
* Be familiar with a few ABM/IBM and their general advantages and disadvantages.
* 


# Videos

This recording is from 2021 and briefly goes over some ABM and intracellular models.
