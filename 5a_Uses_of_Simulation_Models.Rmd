# Overview
Simulation models can be used for different purposes. One way to conceptualize such different uses is shown in this figure.

```{r modelusefig33,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap='Handel et al. 2020 Nat Rev Imm', out.width = '80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./media/nri_review_fig1.png")
```

# Learning Objectives
* Know what simulation models can be used for.
* Be able to differentiate between model use types.
* Know about advantages and disadvantages of different model use types.


# Slides
We will discuss this topic in one of the zoom sessions. You can get the slides here [as html](./slides/Model_Uses_Slides.html) or [as pdf.](./slides/Model_Uses_Slides.pdf)

# Videos

The recordings of the lecture are broken into three segments. 

The first segment discusses use of models for exploration.
