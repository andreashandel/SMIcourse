# Overview
This document describes different uses for simulation models.

# Learning Objectives
* Know what simulation models can be used for.
* Be able to differentiate between model use types.
* Know about advantages and disadvantages of different model use types.


# Slides
We will discuss this topic in one of the zoom sessions. The slides for that session [can be found here.](./slides/Model_Uses_Slides.html)


# Reading

* Our recent review [Simulation Modelling for Immunologists](https://handelgroup.uga.edu/publication/2020-handel-natrevimm/) provides a general introduction to the kinds of simulation models we will be discussing in this course. If you haven't done yet, please read the paper.
