# Overview
This module describes some of the uncertainties that can affect outputs obtained from simulation models.

# Learning Objectives
* Know how different aspects of the model building and running process affect outcomes.
* Be familiar with approaches that allow one to quantify certain types of uncertainty.

# Main sources of model uncertainty

There are a few 

The hardest


Each of these are described in more detail in separate documents in this module.


# Slides
We will discuss this topic in one of the zoom sessions. The slides for that session [can be found here.]()
