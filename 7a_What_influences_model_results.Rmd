# Overview
This module describes some of the uncertainties that can affect outputs obtained from simulation models.

# Learning Objectives
* Know how different aspects of the model building and running process affect outcomes.
* Be familiar with approaches that allow one to quantify certain types of uncertainty.


# Slides
We will discuss this topic in one of the zoom sessions. The slides for that session [can be found here.](./slides/Model_Uses_Slides.html)


# Reading
The other units in this module provide further information on specific topics. Note that there is some overlap between the slides and the reading.


# Further materials

Some of the other readings in this module have further pointers to additional material.
