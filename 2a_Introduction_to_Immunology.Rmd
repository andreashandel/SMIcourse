# Overview
This document provides materials to give you a (VERY!) brief introduction to immunology.

# Learning Objectives
* Understand the major effector arms of the immune system
*  Describe the variation in pathogen “lifestyles” that must be handled by the immune response
* Distinguish innate and adaptive immunity
* Discuss the postulates of the clonal selection hypothesis and their subsequent validation

# Slides
We will go over an introduction to modeling in one of the zoom sessions. The slides for that session [can be found here.](./slides/Introduction_to_Immunology_Slides.pdf)
