This is the current course schedule for the class. Things might change, so check regularly for updates.

The _External Sources_ column only lists major external sources. The course readings provided on this website, as well as other smaller assignments embedded or linked in the course documents (e.g. videos, papers) are not listed. This is only meant as a quick reference, the course readings provide more detail and are the definite source in case of discrepancies.

Abbreviations used are: [DSAIRM = Dyanamical Systems Approach to Immune Response Modeling - R package](https://ahgroup.github.io/DSAIRM/). Numbers refer to the number of the app.
