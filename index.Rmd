Welcome to the website **Simulation Modeling in Immunology (SMI).** 

This website is the main resource for the course/module called [Infectious Diseases, Immunology and Within-Host Models](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/sismid2020/modules/MD2010), which is part of the [Summer Institute in Statistics and Modeling in Infectious Diseases (SISMID)](https://si.biostat.washington.edu/suminst/sismid). The course is taught by [Andreas Handel](https://www.andreashandel.com/) and [Paul Thomas](https://www.stjude.org/directory/t/paul-thomas.html). 

We plan to keep this website continuously online, with updates happening every time we teach the course again - or if we have otherwise time and reason to update things `r emo::ji('smiley')`.


# Notes

We hope this is not too confusing, but we call every unit in our course a _Module_. So this course is a SISMID module, but in our terminology, we call this whole "thing" the _course_ or _class_, and use _module_ for individual segments, which are further divided into _units_.

By default, all links open in the current tab. You'll likely want external ones to open in a separate tab or window. To do so, you can (with most browsers) hold the `Ctrl` button when clicking, or do a right-click and select `open in new tab/window`.


# Website content

The __General Information__ section provides a  __Syllabus__ and a __Schedule__. 


The majority of the content is listed under the __Modules__ heading. Each module has several units in a drop-down/pop-out menu. Go through them in the listed order.

You have the opportunity to do an optional project. Instructions and detailed information for this are given in the __Project__ section.

The __Communication__ section provides information on how course communications are planned to happen.

The __Resources__ section contains a listing of external materials. The _Course Resources_ page lists materials used in this course. The _General Resources_ page lists additional materials that are relevant to the course topic and might be of interest. 

The __Glossary__ section provides a (work in progress) glossary with definitions of technical terms.


# Getting started

Start by looking over the __Syllabus__ and __Schedule__ documents, then __Communication__ and __Resources__. After that, start with the __Module 1__ content in the given order. 


# Contribute

**We welcome contributions in the form of feedback, suggestion for edits/additions, etc. You can either tell us or you can even contribute directly through a GitHub pull request.** (If you don't know what a GitHub pull request is and how you can do that, see the GitHub specific instructions [here](https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/Exercise_Tidyverse.html). You can ignore the part that talks about the `tidyverse`. You might also want to check out [this brief GitHub introduction](https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/1d_Github.html)).
