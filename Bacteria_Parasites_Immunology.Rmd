# Overview
This document provides materials that discuss a few important larger pathogens, specifically TB and Malaria, and the immune response to those pathogens.

# Learning Objectives
* Understand the unique features of malaria and TB biology and their consequences for infection
* Compare and contrast immune effector mechanisms in acute vs. chronic infection settings
* Discuss aspects of pathogen biology that promote chronic infection or immune failure

# Videos

These are recordings from 2020. The first lecture covers Malaria.
