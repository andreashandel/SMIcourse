As in any field, there are lots of technical terms related to Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Modeling. I try to explain them whenever they show up first. However, I figured it might also be useful to have one central place for quick reference. Terms are ordered alphabetically. This is how I define them, others might have different definitions - and so might I in the future, I try to change/update my understanding of things every so often `r emo::ji('grin')`.

Note that in general, there is no regulatory terminology agency, so everyone can use these words to mean whatever they want. While some are fairly well defined, other terms are often used and abused in ways outside the definitions I provide. Always look carefully at what is described to decide what exactly is going on.

This list is and will likely forever remain incomplete. If you think there is a specific term missing that should be listed and explained here, please let me know.

__Mechanistic Modeling:__ Building and using models that explicitly incorporate mechanisms and processes of the system under study to understand _how_ things interact and lead to specific outcomes. Many models in the hard sciences are of this type. A common way to formulate such models is with differential equations.

__Parameter:__ 

__Reproductive Number:__ The expected number of new infected and infectious individuals, created by one individual (of the same type). Also known as __reproductive/reproduction rate__ (bad terminology, it's not a rate.)


__Statistics:__ The basic/classical machinery for data analysis. Depending on the type of data, many different approaches have been developed (parametric vs. non-parametric methods, longitudinal analysis, time-series analysis, and many more). Models tend to be simple and interpretable, the goal is to understand how inputs (predictors) relate to outcomes. Statistics was developed when data was sparse, computers didn't exist, and mainly scientists interested in a deep understanding of their data used it. Because of this, statistical models tend to be simple and work well on small datasets. 

__Statistical Learning:__ A term that seems to become more widely used in recent years. While some people distinguish this term from __Statistics__ and consider it a sub-field (see e.g. Chapter 1 of [_Introduction to Statistical Learning_ ](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/)), the two terms are often used interchangably.


__Variable:__ Any quantity that we consider to change (i.e. be variable). Almost always the change is over time. Contrast that to __Parameter__.
