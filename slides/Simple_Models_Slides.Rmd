## A simple process/simulation model
* We'll start with a very simple model, a population of individuals (humans or animals or pathogens) that grow or die.
* We'll implement the model as a discrete time equation, given by:

$$
P_{t+dt} = P_t + dt ( g P_t - d_P P_t )
$$
$P_t$ are the number of people/pathogens in the population at time $t$, $dt$ is some time step, $g$ is the growth/birth rate and $d_P$ is the death rate.

* What processes exactly does this model describe 'translated into words'?

$P_t$ are the number of people/pathogens in the population at time $t$, $dt$ is some time step, $g$ is the growth/birth rate and $d_P$ is the death rate.

* Why do we multiply by the time step, _dt_?

* If we started with 100 people/pathogens at time t=0, had a growth rate of 12 and death rate of 2 (per year or day), and took time steps of 1 year (or day), how many individual would we have after 1,2,3... years/days?


## A simple simulation model - variant 1
Original:

$$
P_{t+dt} = P_t + dt ( g P_t - d_P P_t )
$$
Alternative:

$$
P_{t+dt} = P_t + dt ( g - d_P P_t )
$$
What's the difference? Is this a good model?


## A simple simulation model - variant 2
Original:

$$
P_{t+dt} = P_t + dt ( g P_t - d_P P_t )
$$
Alternative:

$$
P_{t+dt} = P_t + dt ( g P_t - d_P)
$$

What's the difference? Is this a good model?

## Discrete time models

$$
P_{t+dt} = P_t + dt ( g P_t - d_P P_t )
$$

* The model above is updated in discrete time steps (to be chosen by the modeler).
* Good for systems where there is a "natural"" time step. E.g. some animals always give birth in spring or some bacteria divide at specific times.
* Used in complex individual based models for computational reasons.
* For compartmental models where we track the total populations (instead of individuals), continuous-time models are more common. They are usually formulated as ordinary differential equations (ODE).
* If the time-step becomes small, a discrete-time model approaches a continuous-time model.


## Continuous time models

Discrete:

$$
P_{t+dt} = P_t + dt ( g P_t - d_P P_t )
$$
Re-write:

$$
\frac{P_{t+dt} - P_t}{dt} =  g P_t - d_P P_t 
$$

Continuous:
$$
\frac{dP}{dt}  = gP - d_P P
$$

* If we simulate a continuous time model, the computer uses a smart discrete time-step approximation.

## Some notation
The following are 3 equivalent ways of writing the differential equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\frac{dP(t)}{dt}  &= gP(t) - d_P P(t) \\
\frac{dP}{dt}  &= gP - d_P P \\
\dot{P}  &= gP - d_P P \\
\end{aligned}
$$
We will use the 'dot notation'.


## Some terminology

$$
\dot{P}  = gP - d_P P
$$

* The left side is the instantaneous change in time of the indicated variable.
* Each term on the right side represents a (often simplified/abstracted) biological process/mechanism.
* Any positive term on the right side is an inflow and leads to an increase of the indicated variable.
* Any negative term on the right side is an outflow and leads to a decrease of the indicated variable.


## Extending the model 

$$
\dot{P}  = gP - d_P P
$$

For different values of the parameters _g_ and $d_P$, what broad types of dynamics/outcomes can we get from this model?  


## Extending the model 

$$
\dot{P}  = gP - d_P P
$$

How can we extend the model to get growth that levels off as we reach some high level of _P_?


## Model with saturating growth 
$$
\dot{P}  = gP(1-\frac{P}{P_{max}}) - d_P P
$$
We changed the birth process from exponential/unlimited growth to saturating growth.

## Adding a second variable

* A single variable model is 'boring'.
* The interesting stuff happens if we have multiple compartments/variables that interact.
* Let's introduce a second variable.
* Let's assume that _P_ is a population of some animal or some bacteria, which gets attacked and consumed by some predator, e.g. another animal or the immune system. We'll pick the letter _H_ for the predator (any label is fine). 


## Adding a second variable
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{P} & = gP(1-\frac{P}{P_{max}}) - d_P P \ \pm \ ?\\
\dot{H} & = ?
\end{aligned}
$$

* The predator attacks/eats the prey. What process could we add to the _P_-equation to describe this?

## Adding a second variable
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{P} & = gP(1-\frac{P}{P_{max}}) - d_P P - kPH\\
\dot{H} & = ?
\end{aligned}
$$
* The more _P_ there is, the more the predator will grow, e.g. by eating _P_ or by receiving growth signals. 
* What term could we write down for the growth dynamics of _H_?
* Finally, _H_ individuals have some life-span after which they die. How can we model this?

## Predator-prey model

The model we just built is a version of the well-studied predator-prey model from ecology.
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{P} & = g_P P(1-\frac{P}{P_{max}}) - d_P P - kPH\\
\dot{H} & = g_H P H - d_H H
\end{aligned}
$$

The discrete-time version of the model is:
$$
\begin{aligned}
P_{t+dt} & = P_t + dt(g_P P_t(1-\frac{P_t}{P_{max}}) - d_P P_t - kP_tH_t)\\
H_{t+dt} & = H_t + dt( g_H P_t H_t - d_H H_t)
\end{aligned}
$$


## Bacteria and immune response model

The names of the variables and parameters are arbitrary. If we think of bacteria and the immune response, we might name them _B_ and _I_ instead.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{B} & = g B(1-\frac{B}{B_{max}}) - d_B B - kBI\\
\dot{I} & = r BI - d_I I
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
B_{t+dt} & = B_t + dt(g B_t(1-\frac{B_t}{B_{max}}) - d_B B_t - k B_t I_t)\\
I_{t+dt} & = I_t + dt( r B_t I_t - d_I I_t)
\end{aligned}
$$



## Graphical model representation

* It is important to go back and forth between words, diagrams, equations.
* Diagrams specify a model somewhat, but not completely. The diagram below could be implemented as ODEs (shown) or discrete time or stochastic models.

```{r bacteriadiagram,  fig.cap='',  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("../media/bacteriadiagram.png")
```


$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{B} & = g B(1-\frac{B}{B_{max}}) - d_B B - kBI\\
\dot{I} & = r BI - d_I I
\end{aligned}
$$


## Model exploration
* We could mathematically analyze the model behavior with 'pencil and paper' (or some software, e.g. Mathematica/Maple/Maxima). This only works for simple models. 
* We could analyze the model behavior by simulating it.
* To simulate, we need to implement the model on a computer, specify starting (initial) conditions for all variables and values for all model parameters.

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{P} & = g_P P(1-\frac{P}{P_{max}}) - d_P P - kPH\\
\dot{H} & = g_H P H - d_H H
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{B} & = g B(1-\frac{B}{B_{max}}) - d_B B - kBI\\
\dot{I} & = r BI - d_I I
\end{aligned}
$$

* The _Basic Bacteria Model_ app in DSAIRM allows you to analyze this model graphically.

```


## Notation comment
* If you read the literature, you'll see all kinds of letters used for variables and parameters. That can be confusing but unfortunately unavoidable. 
* Look carefully at models and see how variables/parameters are defined. A model that looks new might in fact be one that you know, just using different notation.
* These 2 models are the same as the model we just saw!

$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{T} &= s - kT -  \beta T V \\
\dot{T^*}&  =  \beta T V - d T^* \\
\dot{V} & =  nT^* - c V -  \beta g TV \\
\end{aligned}
$$
$$
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \lambda - dx - \beta x v \\
\dot{y} & =  \beta x v - a y \\
\dot{v} & =  \kappa y - u v -  \beta g xv \\
\end{aligned}
$$

# A larger virus infection model


## Virus and Immune Response Model
* The immune response is incredibly complex, we still don't know how to model it in much detail.
* We can nevertheless build and explore models that are a (hopefully) good balance between realism and abstraction.
* We'll consider a virus infection model that includes the following components/variables:

* **U** - uninfected cells 
* **I** - infected cells
* **V** - (free) virus
* **F** - innate immune response
* **T** - CD8 T-cells
* **B** - B-cells
* **A** - Antibodies
