# Model uses
* __Exploration:__ We can build and analyze models to better understand the complex dynamics of a system and generate hypotheses.
* __Prediction & What-if scenarios:__ We can perform virtual experiments and make predictions.
* __Hypothesis testing & Parameter Estimation:__ We can fit models to data (inference) to test mechanisms/hypotheses and to estimate parameters.

# Model-aided exploration and hypothesis generation

# Model-aided exploration - an example
* For a single infectious disease outbreak, more intervention/control (through e.g. drugs or social distancing) is generally better.
* If multiple outbreaks are likely and no control is possible beyond the first outbreak (e.g. because of drug resistance or resource limitation) how does the best control strategy change?
* Use a simple model to understand/explore optimal intervention strategies for multi-outbreak settings.
* Details:  Handel et al _"What is the best control strategy for multiple infectious disease outbreaks?"_ Proceedings of the Royal Society B 2007.

# Model Exploration - more examples
* Looking at the dynamics (time-series) of a model can be useful.
* Often, we are not mainly interested in the time series, but instead some more specific quantity, e.g. total number of infected/pathogens, steady state values, etc.
* We usually want to to know how such outcome(s) of interest vary with some parameter(s).
* What do we need to do to answer such questions?

# Model Exploration  
1. Choose some parameter values.
2. Run the simulation model.
3. Record quantities/outcomes of interest.
4. Choose another set of parameter values (usually we only vary one at a time).
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until you got all parameter-outcome pairs of interest.
6. Report (e.g. plot) your findings.

# Exploration - summary
* If the system/question is very simple, we might not need a model (e.g. for a single outbreak, all things equal we know more control is better).
* Infectious disease systems are often complex. If we know little about our system and its behavior, building and exploring simple models is often a useful first step.

---
# Exploration - practice
* We could do the model exploration by hand through the DSAIDE/DSAIRM GUI. 
* We could automate it by writing R code that loops over parameters and repeatedly calls the underlying model (see e.g. 'Level 2' in the package tutorial).
* The _Model Exploration_ app allows you to do such exploration graphically.

# Model-based predictions


---
# Model Predictions/Virtual Experiments
* We saw how we can use models to explore how outcomes of interest change with parameters.
* Model exploration is often useful to gain general insights into a system early on.
* Once we built up our understanding and have a model that we think approximates reality reasonablt well, we can potentially move on to making predictions and explore 'what-if' scenarios (virtual experiments).

---
# Prediction types
* Predictions can be of different types:
  * __Qualitative:__ Try to predict shape/direction of an outcome (similar to the 'exploration' model use).
  * __Semi-quantitative:__ Try to predict the approximate or relative size of an outcome.
  * __Quantitative:__ Try to predict (with confidence intervals) the magnitude of an outcome.

# Prediction - comments
* Simple models are best for qualitative and semi-quantitative predictions. 
  * If we increase vaccination, does incidence/prevalence drop faster or slower than linear? 
  * As we increase drug dose, how does it affect pathogen load?
* If we want to make precise and detailed predictions, we generally need very detailed (complex) models. 
  * Detailed models are 'data hungry' and often the data are not available.
  * Detailed models are difficult to write and analyze.

# Model fitting

# Fitting models to data 

* We build models based on what we assume/know goes on in a specific system.
* We can use models to explore systems and make specific predictions.
* This can be done in the absence of data.
* Adding data to the mix allows us to do more. If we have the right data, we can fit models to it.

```

---
# Model testing/validation
* At some point, we need to bring our model results in contact with data to see how our model performs.
* Ideally, there is a loop/spiral: 
    1. formulate assumptions/hypotheses 
    2. build and analyze model(s) 
    3. generate hypotheses/make predictions 
    4. compare to data 
    5. repeat  

```{r modelusefig3,  echo=FALSE, fig.cap='', out.width = '50%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("./media/schematicfigure.png")
```

---
# Model testing/validation
* The same loop happens in all of science, just often without the explicit use of mathematical models: 
    1. have (specify) assumptions about system
    2. generate hypotheses/predictions based on implicit models
    3. do experiment(s)
    4. compare hypotheses/predictions to data 
    5. repeat


---
# Hypothesis testing with non-mechanistic models
* We usually test hypotheses by collecting data and performing statistical tests to see if there is a pattern (H1) or not (H0). 
* The statistical tests can discriminate between no pattern and some kind of pattern/correlation. 
* If data was collected properly, one can often conclude that there is a causal link. But one can't say much about the mechanisms leading to the observed patterns. 

---
# Hypothesis testing with mechanistic models
* With mechanistic simulation models, we can directly __test hypotheses/mechanisms:__ We can formulate different models, each representing a set of hypotheses/mechanisms. The quality of fit of each model to the date lends support to specific models/mechanisms.
* The mechanism(s) of the best fitting model are more likely to be correct than those of the less good fitting models.

# Model fitting example 1

* Norovirus can cause infection through a common source (e.g. food), or transmit person-to-person. 

* The Question: For a given Norovirus outbreak, is transmission purely person-person, or is there also a common source? 

* The approach: build models for each hypothesis, fit to data and evaluate.

# Model fitting example 2
* Investigate the mechanism of drug action of neuraminidase inhibitors against influenza.

* The Question: What is the mechanism of action of neuraminidase inhibitors, is it reducing virus production of infected cells or infection of uninfected cells?

# Parameter estimates
* By fitting models, we can also __estimate biologically meaningful parameters.__

* Fitting returns estimates for the best-fit parameter values.
* If we believe the model is a decent representation of the real system, we might consider the estimated parameter to be reliable.

# Fitting comments
.pull-left[
* Fitting mechanistic models is conceptually the same as fitting regression models, but technically more challenging.
* If a non-mechanistic model doesn't fit well, we only learned that we need another model.
* If a mechanistic model that was built based on our best knowledge doesn't fit well, we have learned something useful!
* Complex models with many parameters can provide good fits for spurious reasons. 
* It is important to keep models simple to prevent overfitting.
