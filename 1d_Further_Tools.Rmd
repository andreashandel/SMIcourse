# Overview
This is a very short unit with a few pointers to other tools and resources that might be of interest. We won't need then in this course, but some of you might decide to give them a try.


All these readings are from another online course I teach, so there might be some comments that are specific to that course. You can ignore those.


# modelbuilder
The DSAIRM package allows you to explore pre-written models. If you want to modify those models, you will have to get the underlying code and start editing it. This means you'll have to do some R coding. To allow individuals to build their own models without having to code, we started to develop the [modelbuilder]() R package. It is in an early stage, but functional. If interested, you can give it a try and use it to build your own simulation model. You won't have to code. You will still need to ensure your model makes sense.
